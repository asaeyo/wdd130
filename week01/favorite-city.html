    <h1>My Favourite City: Venice</h2>


        <p1>Growing up I have been intrigued about the city of Venice which I got to know through novels like Merchant
            of Vernice by Williams Shakespeare and movies watched. It is a beautiful city in Northeastern Italy known
            for its location in the midst of several islands, with stunning architectural designs. I wish to one day
            visit the city and behold its unique building designs- notably the St. Mark's Basilica, Doge's Palace, Grand
            canal, amongst others.</p1>

        <p2>I would also love to watch their renowned festivals like the Venice carnival, and film festivals.
            Hopefully, my dreams will become a reality in the near future.</p2>
