        <h2>History</h2>
        <section class="history">
            <p><strong>Whitewater rafting </strong> has its roots in the mid-19th century, when rubber rafts were first
                employed by
                military expeditions
                to explore uncharted rivers. It wasn't until the 1970s, however, that the activity gained popularity as
                a recreational sport.
                Since then, whitewater rafting has significantly evolved, thanks to advancement in safety measures and
                equipments- making the
                thrill of the rapids accessible to a much wider audience.

            <img src="../wwr/images/history.jpg" alt="Water Rafting History">
            <p>The term"whitewater" refers to the frothy, fast-moving water created as a river flows over rocks, sudden
                drops and other natural
                obstacles. Rapids are classified by difficulty on a scale from Class I (easy and gentle) to Class
                V (extremely challenging and technical),
                offering options for every skill level- from beginners to seasoned adventurers. At white water rafting,
                expert guidance is provided from
                experienced instructors. What began as a modest means of exploration has since grown into a globally
                popular activity, attracting adventure
                enthusiasts from all corners of the world.
